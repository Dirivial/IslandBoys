# IslandBoys
A game where you conquer each other's islands.

# How to use, without using git (you wonÂ´t be able to push changes)
There might be a better way to do this but this is how I would do it:

## Step 1 - Create Project
Open Unity and create a new project using the 3D URP template. I am using Unity 2022.3.4f1 - so if your version does not work, try this one.

## Step 2 - Import Files
Download the files in the repository, extract them, then copy/paste the assets & project settings into the project you created in Step 1.

The template already has some asset files in it, but you should be able to remove those.

## Step 3 - Enjoy
You should be able to use the project now! :-)
